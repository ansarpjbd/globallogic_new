//installation of java
//installation of eclipse

Open the Eclipse
#Choose the workspace or create new workspace
#workspace--it is working directory for java application
#create a java Application 
             --File--> New--> Other Project
			 
			 --Type Java Application in search bar
			 
			 --Select the Java Project
			 
You have to give the Application Properties	
#Name --After giving the project name click on next
       --Again Click on next screen
	   --Create Modules Info. DO not create this one

#Java Package--it is like a folder or directory in oS
             --it is used to store the related file of one project

     Package--> #it start with company name domain

			#give the company name

Jre

Work with JDK
You have to change the jre to JDK

Already taken the project follow these steps:
right click on the project
>go to build path
>Go to Libraries 
>Select the JRE system and click on remove
>Select the Modules Path and add the Libraray
>Select the JRE system Libraray
>Click on Install JRes
>Select the installed JRe Libraray
>Click on remove to delete this Libraray
>Click on Add to add the new Libraray
>Click on next and select the path of installed java 

#JDk installed in system
#JDK config in the eclipse


#Reading the Data and Wrtiing the Data on memory
   >each language has the features to add and remove the data to menory
   >variable in all the language 
   >becuase you have have different value in same memory place

#DataType
#Identifer
#Operator
#Heap Memory
#Stack Memory

OOPS concept---object oritneted programining language 
in most of the language

//object oritneted Application
class and object
inheritance(completed)
encapsulation (completed)
polymorphism(completed)
Abstraction(completed)
        //it is concept that does not have any implementation
		//cell phone(it is idea or concept)
		//implementation class
		//two ways of absraction:
		//interface 
		//abstract class
		
		#callphone--calling
		         #--send sms
         #must have the implemented class
    


#class and Object ,method
#Inheritance -- reuse usabality of code 
         --two class will have parent child relatiosnhip
		 --base class and child
		 --you can use the extends keyword
             -- we have two classes these two class will have class A

//basic data type : int , float ,double. char
//Wrapper--: becuase it has encapsulated the already existed class like int , float or double
//in java we have requirement to convert basic data type to object or class
create the method of wrapper
Byte --byte

Long --long
Integer --int
Character-->char
Boolean ---boolean


//version control github
   //it is maintain the different files version
  //you can update the code and later you can share the code and download the code

#Github :Repositories :it is like new url assign to gihubcode
  #it is directory or folder where you can update the code with help of github commands
  
  //create a new Respoitoty:
    //Repository name
	 //it is public  --anyone on the internet will be able to access your code

//private--you can share the code by adding the person

 https://github.com/ansarpjbd/globallogic
 
 
 //upload the code
 
git init --it is used to intitalize the repo

git add foldername --it is use to add the folder to github

git commit -m "first commit"  #adding ther files to repo

git branch -M main    //explain 

//add the url with token
 
#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

git remote add origin https://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@github.com/ansarpjbd/globallogic_new.git

git push -u origin main


 
 //download the code

  git clone https://github.com/ansarpjbd/globallogic_new


#Exception Handling : there can be situation when you code is running there will be problem in executing the code.

      >Error --it stop the jvm (if error is there)
	  >Exception--it is kind of error but this will not halt the jvm . 
	            >Program will still run 
				
	> Resoruces which you are using	 got failed
   >you should not stop the work
   >search for alternative resources and start working again
   
   Full Flag Freamwork here for Exception
   --> Throwable
    --->  Exception
	    --> Runtime Exception(Checked Exception)    --> IO Exception (Unchecked ) 
  
			
Collection : it is freamwork in java 
           : it is collections of classes:
