//Polymorphism --it is combined with two words
//poly means many
//morphism --forms

//our application or class is capable to take any form at any time

//Entity //Trainers 
//Employee 
//Person

//there is change in the behaviour 

//method overloading --//it will be completed within the same class
                        //we will same the method in same class with same name and different parameters
                        //static binding
                        //compiler know at the compile time which method to calls
                         //because when will call the method it looks for method name and parameters 
                         //matching method name and parameters then it is able to link these
//method overriding -- //you should have implemented the inheritance for method overriding 
                      //base class method will be overriding by child class method
                       //both should have the same method name and return type
                      //you should have the input parameters also same
                      //runtime -it is not able to get which method to call at compile time
