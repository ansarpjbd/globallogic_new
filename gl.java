   >variable in all the language 
   >becuase you have have different value in same memory place

in most of the language

//object oritneted Application
class and object
inheritance(completed)
encapsulation (completed)
polymorphism(completed)
Abstraction(completed)
        //it is concept that does not have any implementation
		//cell phone(it is idea or concept)

		//two ways of absraction:

		//abstract class
		
		#callphone--calling
		         #--send sms
         #must have the implemented class
    


#class and Object ,method
#Inheritance -- reuse usabality of code 
         --two class will have parent child relatiosnhip
		 --base class and child
		 --you can use the extends keyword
             -- we have two classes these two class will have class A
